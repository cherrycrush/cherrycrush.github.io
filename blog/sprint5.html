  <h3>Preparing for bootcamp</h3>
  <h4>Long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
  <p>
    I'm aiming to get a junior position in the tech industry and eventually become an experienced programmer. I want to explore different languages and technologies as I become more experienced. I have an interest in game design as well.
  </p>
  <h4>Strengths and limitations during bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    I think my commitment to working on things daily and being organised will be my biggest strengths, as well as having the right attitude. My weakness may be that I work too intensely on one thing and lose track of time or get a little behind.
  </p>
  <h4>Biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    Connecting with people online will be a challenge. I think that in person would be much easier, but I am prepared to do what it takes.
  </p>
  <h4>Human/non-tech skills to see develop while at bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    Having that chemistry with someone that translates into productive pair programming and problem solving. 
  </p>
  <h4>Expectations of yourself at bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    Reaching out to staff when I think I'm struggling or falling behind and not getting it. Keeping myself fully committed in the 9-10 weeks of bootcamp, making sure I don't get sidetracked by other distractions and only making plans for friends and family after work time.

  <h3>Foundations Core Reflection</h3>
  <h4>Three new things discovered about yourself and your ego from the core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    For one, I enjoy learning new things. For two, I can be distracted and lose track of time easily. For three, I get hung up on little details and take a while to move onto the next problem.
  </p>
  <h4>Values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
  <p>
    Being open to new ideas, open to criticism and having patience to go through the process carefully and stay focussed. Having empathy and self awareness allows people to open up and allow the free flow exchange of feelings and ideas. If these don't serve a role in your work, you may find your productivity hindered or the result of the work not achieving a higher standard.
  </p>
  <h4>Most surprising aspect of core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    I wish to learn more about neuroplasticity as its a relatively new field of study and I'm excited to see what discoveries are made in neuroscience and how we can process new information more effectively and be more primed to learn new concepts easily. 
  </p>
  <h4>Challenging aspects of core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    Being open about things that I usually keep to myself. I don't think I'm a totally closed off person but I find I prefer keeping my inner thoughts and feelings mostly private.
  </p>
  <h4>Why are we spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
  <p>
    I think it prepares you well for the real world and the reality of working in the industry. It can be stressful job and you've got to work with people. Having the human skills allows us to work better together as programmers but also as human beings.
  </p>
  <h4>Should you have just used this time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
  <p>
    I believe the time spent learning about human skills and how we should practice mindfulness and being able to empathize with others is key to becoming a better programmer in the long run.
