	<h3>Technical Primer</h3>
	<h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
	<p>One analogy to describe HTML and CSS: HTML is like the main ingredients to make ice cream like milk, cream, sugar. While CSS could be seen viewed as the toppings or decorations on the icecream. Such as chocolate sauce, sprinkles, sherbert, waffle cone etc.</p>

	<h3>EQ and IQ</h3>
	<h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
	<p>Emotional intellgience is having the awareness and ability to recognize what you and others are feeling through body language, tone of voice and so on.</p>
	<h4>How is it different from IQ?</h4>
	<p>IQ is a measure of problem solving, abstract thinking and how quickly one can process information. It is widely used as a measurement of intelligence and as an indicator of how well one can analyze and process information. EQ is an indicatior of how well someone can understand the feelings of others and work co-operatively, it is linked closely to the openness and agreeableness traits as part of the 'Big 5' personality traits: Conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, extraversion and neuroticism.</p>
	<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
	<p>It is important to be able to relate to others, feel empathy and allow yourself to open up. Having some form of emotional intelligence is what helped humans better able to work together to overcome adversity. We have evolved to read and understand others' emotions through body language and tone of voice.</p>
