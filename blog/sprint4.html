  <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth mindset</h3>
  <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
  <p>
    Neuroplasticity is a process in the brain where it has the ability to change and mould the neural networks of the brain. Understanding that the brain is malleable and has the ability to change and strengthen neural pathways has demonstrated to give people a higher confidence in themselves to perform in school. With the understanding of these princples - that the brain is constantly changing and not in a fixed state is key to finding benefits. By practicing memory recall, engaging in new and novel tasks, exploring new environments creates the appropriate environment for a heathly brain. Those who regularly have high quality sleep of 8-9 hours, challenge themselves and try new things are more likely to receive these benefits. This understanding of neuroplasticity and practice can reduce the onset of dementia in older age.

  <h4>Growth vs Fixed mindset</h4>
  <p>
    A growth mindset is a mindset that is open minded in the approach to learning, believing that when something is not known it is reinforced with "I don't know yet". This also encompasses the belief that there is always room for improvement, being open to new ideas, and not pretrending to know the answers to everything. On the flipside, there is a fixed mindset - which you coast along with perhaps some innate talent. That path leads to a fixed mindset, where you don't learn anything. You give up when approaching new problems that challenge you.
  <p>
    I'm more interested in having a growth mindset, especially on my journey with EDA. I'm coming in realising that I don't know everything and that in tech there will always be something new to learn, new ways to solve problems. In my research on this topic I want to set smaller and achievable goals, encourage hard work and be open to critcism from others.

  <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
  <h4>Problem with an elegant solution</h4>
  <p>
    One of the Kata exercises was to create an object for a couple with children. I had wrote the program in such a way that it would do one thing at a time line by line. The program worked and all but I felt like there was a better way to solve it and make the code look cleaner.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the process I used a lot of google, some pseudocode and also helping someone else out with the same problem is what led me to find a better solution. I figured out how to create objects inside other objects, something so simple yet it didn't occur to me in the first program I wrote. I relied on a create object function to get by.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lesson I learnt from this process was the fact that there are multiple ways of writing a program to do the same thing. It was cool discovering a simpler way of expressing the object that looked better to read, and accomplished the same goal.
  </p>
  <h4>Blocked on a simple problem</h4>
  <p>
    Another kata exercise involved the FizzBuzz exercise. I had to print fizz for every multiple of 3, buzz for every multiple of 5 and 15 for every multiple of 15. I knew the solution involved an if/else series of statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the process I came to a halt when trying to figure out the operator for working through the multiples and trying to get FizzBuzz on every 15. I took a look at the solutions file and saw that the order of the if/else statements were different from mine. The solutions also had a '%' operator. I used those operators and I swapped the statements in my program and it worked.
  </p>
  <p> 
    A lesson I learned in this exercise is to take more time trying to work out your own solution because there are many solutions to a problem. Also that looking at others' solutions is fine as long as you understand whats going on and not just copy/pasting code.
  </p>
  <h4>Techniques</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Pseudo Code:</strong> I used a bit of pseudo code to flesh out the steps involved in each process of the program. Sometimes I'd put examples in there to help me and use simple and clear language.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Trying something: </strong>This is often my go-to, in the early stages I'd just test a bunch of different methods off the top of my head. This is my preferred way of exploring new things - having the freedom to try different things.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Error messages: </strong>I try to make sense of error messages. Some are easy to figure out but some of the language used in the error messages comes off a bit abstract for me. Perhaps with more experience I'll be able to know what is going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Rubber ducky: </strong>I didn't necessarily use this method, as I don't feel comfortable talking to a duck but I found talking to someone else or talking out loud by myself helped a little.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Console.log(): </strong>This is another go-to method for me, as you can see what the codes doing, or what its not doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Google: </strong>Another goto method, but usually I do this after I've exhausted the other problem solving techniques first. I know that googling is a good skill to have so I'm not afraid to use it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Peers and Coach assistance: </strong> I didn't use this one much, if I think if I've exhausted all other methods then I'd ask people for help.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reflection: </strong>I try to do this when I'm doing an unrelated task or even when I'm helping someone else out with a different problem entirely.
