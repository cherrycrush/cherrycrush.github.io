  <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth mindset</h3>
  <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
  <p>
    Neuroplasticity is a process in the brain where it has the ability to change and mould the neural networks of the brain. Understanding that the brain is malleable and has the ability to change and strengthen neural pathways has demonstrated to give people a higher confidence in themselves to perform in school. With the understanding of these princples - that the brain is constantly changing and not in a fixed state is key to finding benefits. By practicing memory recall, engaging in new and novel tasks, exploring new environments creates the appropriate environment for a heathly brain. Those who regularly have high quality sleep of 8-9 hours, challenge themselves and try new things are more likely to receive these benefits. This understanding of neuroplasticity and practice can reduce the onset of dementia in older age.
