  <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth mindset</h3>
  <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
  <p>
    Neuroplasticity is a process in the brain where it has the ability to change and mould the neural networks of the brain. Understanding that the brain is malleable and has the ability to change and strengthen neural pathways has demonstrated to give people a higher confidence in themselves to perform in school. With the understanding of these princples - that the brain is constantly changing and not in a fixed state is key to finding benefits. By practicing memory recall, engaging in new and novel tasks, exploring new environments creates the appropriate environment for a heathly brain. Those who regularly have high quality sleep of 8-9 hours, challenge themselves and try new things are more likely to receive these benefits. This understanding of neuroplasticity and practice can reduce the onset of dementia in older age.

  <h4>Growth vs Fixed mindset</h4>
  <p>
    A growth mindset is a mindset that is open minded in the approach to learning, believing that when something is not known it is reinforced with "I don't know yet". This also encompasses the belief that there is always room for improvement, being open to new ideas, and not pretrending to know the answers to everything. On the flipside, there is a fixed mindset - which you coast along with perhaps some innate talent. That path leads to a fixed mindset, where you don't learn anything. You give up when approaching new problems that challenge you.
  <p>
    I'm more interested in having a growth mindset, especially on my journey with EDA. I'm coming in realising that I don't know everything and that in tech there will always be something new to learn, new ways to solve problems. In my research on this topic I want to set smaller and achievable goals, encourage hard work and be open to critcism from others.
