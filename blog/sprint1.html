    <h3>Identity, Values and Strengths</h3>
    <h4>Personal Values</h4>
    <p>
      My core values and beliefs find roots in how my parents and grandparents raised me. Mostly influenced by the golden rules. I would describe them as:
    </p>
<ul class="content-list">
  <li>Treat others like how you’d want to be treated</li>
  <li>Respect other people and their property</li>
  <li>Be honest and uphold your integrity</li>
  <li>Don't discriminate people based on their sex, gender or religious beliefs</li>
  <li>Offer help to your fellow human beings, be a role model - someone to look up to</li>
  <li>Have a growth mindset, always strive to learn</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Ethical Decisions: Values and Consequences</h4>
    <p>
      I was working in the automotive industry, and my employer was not mindful with regards to disposing oil and waste. Oil was running into a drain that led to the waikato waterways. I reported the issue to my employer and told them that if they dont do something about it, the company will be in serious trouble. After that we cleaned up the mess, and later small barriers were installed to prevent oil from running into the drain again.
    </p>
    <h4>Cultural Influences</h4>
    <p>
      I grew up in little ol’ Tokoroa, its a very laid back, easy going bubble. Everyone knows everyone and so word gets around fast. People take their time getting around and there is no rush to get work done so to speak. Life is ~chill~.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe the culture of Tokoroa has had an influence on my personality, I was more introverted, quiet and did not go out much - I valued these traits as part of my identity. However jump to 2016, I had to grow. I've been living in Hamilton for a few years now, and I can say that it has impacted my personality. More opportunity - socially and academically. I had to open up to new people and different cultures. This caused me to develop a more outgoing and extroverted personality.
    </p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>
      I am inquisitive, willing to try different approaches to solve a particular problem I think will help me in my journey, especially being in the online cohort. I believe one of my strengths is to adapt to my environment, even when its constantly changing.
    </p>
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>
      I’ve been floating around doing different things, having not focussed on one career for more than a year or two. One strength i find of this is that it has lead me to experience a variety of different people and working environments. A limitation of this is that it shows that I haven't been decisive and prone to changing my mind on things.
    </p>
    <h4>Conflicts</h4>
    <p>
      When I was working in a workshop we had to work in pairs. Me and my partner serviced about a dozen vehicles a day. I did the oil changes and tyre checks, he did more visual checks as he was more experienced. One day I wanted to do more visual checks to get more experience but he was not having it. I decided to purchase my own flashlight and mirror to prove to him that I'm ready. I asked him to show me how he performs these visual checks, and he agreed to. Conflict solved!
