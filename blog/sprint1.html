    <h3>Me, myself and I</h3>
    <h4>Cultural Influences</h4>
    <p>
      I grew up in little ol’ Tokoroa, its a very laid back, easy going bubble. Everyone knows everyone and so word gets around fast. People take their time getting around and there is no rush to get work done so to speak. Life is ~chill~.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe the culture of Tokoroa has had an influence on my personality, I was more introverted, quiet and did not go out much - I valued these traits as part of my identity. However jump to 2016, I had to grow. I've been living in Hamilton for a few years now, and I can say that it has impacted my personality. More opportunity - socially and academically. I had to open up to new people and different cultures. This caused me to develop a more outgoing and extroverted personality.
    </p>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>
      I am inquisitive, willing to try different approaches to solve a particular problem I think will help me in my journey, especially being in the online cohort. I believe one of my strengths is to adapt to my environment, even when its constantly changing.
    </p>
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>
      I’ve been floating around doing different things, having not focussed on one career for more than a year or two. One strength i find of this is that it has lead me to experience a variety of different people and working environments. A limitation of this is that it shows that I haven't been decisive and prone to changing my mind on things.
